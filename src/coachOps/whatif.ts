// The what-if (v2 wave 5, "Ask"): the athlete asks a hypothetical in their own words,
// and the team answers with ONE proposed change and its ripple across the six stones.
//
// Two ops, deliberately separate:
//
//   whatIf()   — a READ. It runs one agent turn over the projected coach context (the
//                `what_if` prompt site) under an enforced schema, and returns
//                {ok, change, ripple[]}. It NEVER writes: no proposal, no ledger row, no
//                cache entry. A dead rotation is the designed {ok:false, error, tried}.
//   whatIfDo() — the "Do it" hand-off. It takes the what-if JOB's id and reads the
//                question and the change from the server's own stored answer (a client
//                never supplies the change, so it can never drop the clinical mark),
//                re-validates it, writes it as a DRAFT plan proposal, and routes that
//                draft through the ONE autonomy policy
//                (applyProposalWithAutonomy → decideAutonomyTier). It never applies on
//                its own authority: the policy decides the tier, and
//                  - anything clinical is held clinician-directed (the chat detector, now
//                    shared, reads the athlete's words and the change itself);
//                  - a calorie/protein target always waits on the athlete — the what-if
//                    did not run the check-in's protective caps, so the team never lands
//                    that number on its own (a half-target is completed from the active
//                    target, so the draft is always one the athlete can approve);
//                  - a training edit read against a plan that has moved since is
//                    requested at `ask`, never landed quietly: the policy then holds it
//                    (or, under lead mode, announces it with the one-tap Undo);
//                  - a goal (or anything without a concrete edit) is never drafted at
//                    all — a goal is the athlete's to name, in their own words.
//
// The `stub` agent is the offline smoke path, as it is for propose/apply: its canned
// reply is proposal-shaped, so asking it for a what-if answers from a small authored
// table instead (whatIfFloor), deterministically and with no spawn.
