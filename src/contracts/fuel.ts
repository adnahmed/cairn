// The Fuel contract (v2 wave 2, "Food, the logging already done every day, made editable").
//
// Three server-owned reads the Fuel surface paints and the coach reads:
//   - the PROTEIN ANCHOR — the day's protein target, which always comes first;
//   - the OBSERVED INTAKE BAND — where this athlete's weight turned, read only off the
//     days `classifyIntakeDay` calls complete plus the bodyweight response over the same
//     weeks (src/repo/intake-band.ts). An observation, never a target and never a
//     maintenance measurement; it bounds ENERGY only and never trims protein;
//   - FUEL IDEAS — three deterministic ideas built from the athlete's own staples,
//     sized to the rest of today inside that band, protein first (src/repo/fuel-ideas.ts).
//     An idea is never a plan and is never shown as eaten: "Start from this" fills the
//     composer, and nothing is logged until the person logs it.
//
// Served by `GET /api/nutrition/intake-band` (`get_intake_band`) and
// `GET /api/fuel/ideas` (`get_fuel_ideas`). Every sentence arrives finished — a renderer
// frames it and never works it out again. Numbers carry units; there is no score.
//
// Self-contained on purpose: src/client/** can read these types through
// `import("../contracts/fuel.js")`, and this module imports nothing.
