// A CLINICIAN ASK, SPOKEN TO THE ATHLETE.
//
// A decision the team holds for the athlete and their doctor (`for_clinician` on
// awaitingBrainDecisions — a clinician-floor hold, or a conference's clinical note) carries
// sentences an agent wrote. A conference's parallel actions are written for the TEAM, and
// live one read as a clinician's note about the athlete in the third person ("Facilitate
// athlete coordination with <a named physician> regarding …"), which the ask card and the
// visit questions then printed verbatim, clipped mid-word. Nothing here rewrites what is
// stored; this is the athlete-register projection every surface reads instead:
//
//   - the VISIT QUESTION is one short question the athlete would ask their doctor: the
//     clinical topics the decision names, from a fixed vocabulary ("Should we talk about a
//     statin and a carotid ultrasound?"), else its athlete-facing title ("Can we talk about
//     <title>?"), else nothing — the ask still lives on the ask card.
//   - the ASK CARD keeps a sentence that was written for the athlete; one in the
//     clinician's register is replaced by that question.
//
// Cairn wording never introduces a clinician's personal name: the vocabulary names none,
// and agent text that does is not the athlete's own words, so it never passes through.
