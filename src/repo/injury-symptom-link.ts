// ============================================================================
// RESOLVED MEANS RESOLVED — one pain, two records.
//
// The same complaint routinely lands twice: the session note becomes a training
// symptom (the lifecycle the athlete closes with "Resolved"), and the chat turn that
// heard it files an `injury` context event for the timeline. The athlete then closes
// the one they can see — the symptom — and the injury event, which nothing ties to it,
// kept producing a protective hard constraint every morning: a flank note resolved on
// Monday was still excluding lifts and reading the day as "working around" it on
// Tuesday.
//
// This is the tie, and it is READ-SIDE on purpose. Nothing is stamped or deleted: an
// open injury event whose twin symptom the athlete resolved simply reads as resolved,
// and the day that symptom comes back (recurTrainingSymptom reopens the row) the event
// reads as open again with it. No data moves, so no migration is needed for rows that
// already exist.
//
// The link is deliberately narrow — a false tie would silently drop a real injury:
//   • the event is an `injury`, and the symptom an AREA symptom (a systemic "everything
//     feels off" names no place, so it can never stand for one),
//   • the SAME EPISODE: the symptom's onset sits within EPISODE_WINDOW_DAYS of the
//     event's start, and it was resolved on/after that start (a resolution that
//     predates the event cannot speak for it — that is a NEW episode),
//   • the SAME PLACE: no side conflict (left vs right), and either the same area
//     vocabulary label or a shared place word once the narration is stripped.
