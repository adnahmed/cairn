// principle, read by the race build (each rung's `strength_hint`, the build's
// `strength.principle` and the with-lifting line), and through them by the prompts
// and the Run/Race surfaces. Never a second copy of these sentences anywhere else.
//
// The answer depends on who the athlete IS, not only on how far away the race is. A
// strength-led athlete (`isStrengthLedIntent`: endurance role none/supporting, or
// endurance ranked below both muscle and strength) keeps PROGRESSING through the whole
// build — full sets, ordinary load steps — and only the legs are trimmed, and only in
// the last two weeks, by the stress budget (stress-budget.ts): taper week the leg lifts
// go lighter with fewer sets, race week the heavy leg lifts sit out. The upper body
// keeps progressing through both. An endurance-led athlete (primary / co_primary, or a
// derived intent) keeps the classic race-build lifting arc: maintenance loads while
// sharpening, light and fast in the taper, legs off in race week.
//
// Pure: fixtures in, words out. The caller reads the intent once and passes the lead.
