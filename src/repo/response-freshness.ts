// The freshness key behind the HTTP response memo (src/routes/response-memo.ts): one
// string that moves whenever anything a memoized Today/Horizon read could depend on
// moves, so a repeat GET can be answered — or a 304 given — BEFORE the read is
// computed again.
//
// It is built from the signatures the process-wide memos already trust:
//   • coachContextBackstopSignature() — row counts, high-water marks, an UPDATE
//     odometer over every table the coach context reads, the profile and settings
//     rows by value, and the training/food/coach counters (repo/training-cache.ts);
//   • currentMarkerDataVersion() — the marker-history counter (repo/marker-cache.ts);
//   • the local DATE, the device zone, and a short wall-clock SLOT (below).
// plus ONE addition of its own: an odometer over the bookkeeping tables those reads
// consult but the coach context deliberately leaves out — app_state (the "since you
// last looked" stamp, the Changes feed's seen marker, a drained backlog), agent_jobs
// and ai_cache (a week-ahead or weekly read landing), agent_availability (whether an
// agent is usable colours the Brief's agent status), the exercise-guide index and the
// Garmin source rows. Freshness beats speed: over-invalidation only costs a recompute.
//
// The SLOT is ten minutes rather than the coach memo's hour. A few reads carry a
// minute-level clock of their own (the fuel pace model's "expected by now"), and a
// response memo must never hold one of those past the point a fresh compute would
// have said something different for long. Ten minutes still covers every burst of
// opens and background revalidations, which is where the memo earns its keep.
//
// Leaf-ish on purpose: it imports only the two signature leaves and the clock, so a
// route module can read it without dragging a repo cycle in.
