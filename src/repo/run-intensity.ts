// HOW HARD A RUN WAS — read off the athlete, never the watch (owner law, 2026-09-25:
// "Garmin te_label must never classify his runs; use the personal HR model").
//
// The one answer every intensity reader asks for a RUN with an average heart rate and
// a usable personal model: the harm read's hard-cardio bar (`hardCardioDayCore`), the
// day-load grade (`cardioEffort`/`dayLoad`, training-read.ts) and the per-muscle
// endurance dose (`classifyImpactLoad`, hybrid-load.ts). A run is HARD when
//   • `classifyRunEffort` reads it as quality against his own zones (above the steady
//     band for 12+ minutes, or 75+ minutes held in it);
//   • the athlete NAMED it quality ("Hills", "5k+sprints", "LT HR Test" —
//     `namesQualityRun`): an interval day's recoveries pull the average into the
//     steady band, and his title is his own input;
//   • he RAN it as a structured interval workout on the watch (≥3 work bouts with
//     recoveries and ≥6 min of work — `intervalSessionEvidence`, run-structure.ts):
//     the workout he chose and executed is input of the same standing as his title.
//     Its own work laps, read against HIS easy line, can still say the bouts were
//     all easy (a run/walk workout) — the watch's labels never grade it;
//   • HARD_EFFORT.z4Seconds sat in heart-rate bins lying wholly ABOVE his threshold
//     band (bin floor > z4_top). Garmin's bins are drawn on Garmin's zones, so a bin
//     straddling his line proves nothing either way.
// Training effect, te_label, time in Garmin's Z4 and the training load no longer speak
// for such a run: the load is Garmin's EPOC estimate, the quantity the training effect
// is itself computed from.
//
// Null means the personal model cannot judge (not a run, no heart rate, no usable
// model) and the caller keeps its old bars — rides, hikes, runs before any model.
// A run the athlete STATED easy (stated-effort.ts) is not hard whatever this says;
// callers check that first, since it holds with or without a model.

// ---------- how LONG is long, for THIS runner ----------
//
// Two readers ask "was this run long enough to count on its length alone": the
// per-muscle dose (a run past the modality's long bar is a HEAVY leg dose,
// hybrid-load.ts) and the day grade (a run past CARDIO_GRADE.hardMin/hardKm is a
// HARD loading day, training-read.ts `cardioEffort`). Both bars were fixed — 55 min /
// 9 km and 50 min / 9 km — so for a runner whose ordinary run is ~40 minutes, most
// of his week read as long runs and every morning after one read as recovering (owner
// ruling, 2026-09-29: push forward, judge by his own data).
//
// So the bar is RELATIVE to his own recent running: OWN_RUN_LONG_MULTIPLE × the median
// duration / distance of his runs over the OWN_RUN_WINDOW_DAYS before the day — a run
// is long when it is clearly past his ordinary one. Bounded on both sides:
//   • never below the fixed bar the caller passes in: a novice, or an athlete with
//     fewer than OWN_RUN_MIN_RUNS runs in the window, keeps today's defaults exactly;
//   • never above OWN_RUN_BAR_CAP (90 min / 16 km): past that a run is long for anyone.
// And the raised bar never demotes his genuine long run: a run that clears the FIXED
// bar stays long when it is
//   • on his stated LONG-run weekday (the build's long run is the long run), or
//   • at least LONG_RUN_SHARE_OF_LONGEST (75%) of the longest run in the window.
// Neither rule ever makes a run long that the fixed bar would not — they only keep the
// relative bar from reading his long run as an ordinary one.
