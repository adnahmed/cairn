// WHAT OF THIS WEEK IS ALREADY BEHIND THE ATHLETE — the one answer every week-layout
// read is handed (src/domain/training/week-layout.ts `closed`). A layout suggestion is
// advice about the days still ahead: it may never ask the athlete to move a lift they
// have already trained, onto a day that has already gone by, or to protect a key run
// they have already run. Every caller (the race build, the Plan strip, the coach
// context) derives that from the log through this helper, so the three can never
// disagree about which days are still open.
//
//   days       weekday slots (Mon = 1 … Sun = 7) before `asOf` in its Mon–Sun week,
//              plus `asOf` itself once a lift is logged on it (a session with sets).
//   runs_done  a long / quality intent the flexible agenda already reads as completed
//              this week — on whatever day it was run (a Thursday quality session run
//              on Tuesday is done, and Wednesday's legs no longer sit before it).

// ---------- THE WEEK CLOSED EARLY (2026-10-04) ----------
//
// A Mon–Sun week used to count as closed only once Monday came round, so a week whose
// running was all done by Sunday morning — the long run in, no run day left — kept
// reading as its prescription until the next day: the race ladder walked on from the
// planned 19.5 km while 35.8 km had actually been run.
//
// The smallest sound rule, deliberately conservative:
//   • `asOf` is the week's last day, Sunday — never earlier. A Tue/Thu runner's week
//     closed on Thursday would be counted as a harm-free closed week (capacity, the
//     ladder's floor) before the next morning that can show its last run's harm exists,
//     then fall back on Friday: the ladder moving twice in two days. By Sunday every
//     run but a Sunday one has its next morning on record, and a Sunday run's is
//     Monday's, when the week closes in the ordinary way anyway;
//   • the athlete has STATED run days (no stated calendar → never closed early: with no
//     named weekdays nothing says the running is over), and
//   • a run is logged on the LAST stated run day, or every one of the agenda's intents
//     is completed.
// An unstated day (an optional Saturday ride, a spontaneous run) never holds the week
// open — and a run logged after the early close simply reads into the week next time.
