// THE WHOLE-WEEK LOAD READ — every sport plus the lifting, in one picture.
//
// The prompts used to get the week in fragments: raw activity rows, a week of runs, a
// two-day muscle list, the saturated gates, the run agenda. None of them said "Saturday
// was a long ride, Sunday the long run, and Monday is a leg day" in one place, so a model
// had to assemble the week itself — and could not, because the fragments disagree on
// window and on what counts. This read assembles it ONCE, deterministically, from the
// reads that already own each answer:
//
//   runs        — the week's run closures (flexible-training-agenda: the agenda's own
//                 matcher, its grading by stated effort → personal model → watch)
//   cross       — recentEnduranceImpacts (hybrid-load: family, load band, stated easy)
//   strength    — the logged session (title, sessionLoad) and the acute gates for the
//                 groups it trained (strengthLegLoad / acuteGates)
//   day_load    — dayLoad (training-read: the day's harder of lifting and cardio)
//   intents     — flexibleTrainingAgenda (what the week planned and what closed it)
//   cross day   — crossTrainingDays (stated, else the observed pattern)
//   next 48 h   — the agenda's suggested dates, the stated calendar (calendarDayRead)
//                 and the lifting map (thisWeekPlanDayMap), and the leg gate.
//
// NOTHING here grades, matches, windows or doses anything of its own: no SQL, no type
// regexes, no TE/zone/HR thresholds. Where a read is silent the field is null or empty.
// No scores and no internal magnitudes (residual, bar, heavy_ratio) ever leave it; the
// one athlete-facing string (`next_48h.line`) rotates through pickDayVariant.
