// The Today and Horizon-race fan-ins: the bodies other GET routes answer, computed
// in ONE request and keyed by the exact path the PWA would have asked for them.
//
// A Today open used to fire ~25 GETs across several serial waves (the plan-day
// pick, the run line, the side panels, the stones, the directives, the Changes
// line, and the rail cards the agenda names). Over a phone link the cost is request
// count x round trip, so `/today?surface=today` carries all of them in `responses`
// and the client primes its request layer (api-core apiPrime) from it — every
// loader keeps asking for its own path and simply gets its answer without a trip.
//
// The contract that keeps this honest:
//   • each entry is produced by the SAME function the individual route calls, with
//     the same arguments, so the body is byte-identical to that route's answer;
//   • the individual routes all still exist and answer identically — a client that
//     knows nothing about `responses` keeps working, and this is free to degrade;
//   • degradation is per entry: a reader that throws simply leaves its path out,
//     and that one loader falls back to its own request;
//   • side-effecting reads are included only when the surface that renders them is
//     actually on this open — the agenda names the card — exactly as the client
//     loaders decide, so a backlog drain or a week-ahead job never fires for a card
//     nobody drew.
