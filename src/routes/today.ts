// One server read for the whole Today open: the independent low-risk reads the
// client used to fetch separately (/plan, /sessions?date=, /stats, /profile,
// /exercises) PLUS the per-plan-day last sets, that day's progression, the
// strength journey, the salience agenda and the conductor's focus. Every one of
// those routes still exists and answers identically — this only collapses the
// request count; the client still primes their individual SWR keys.
//
// `?surface=today` (the Today tab) widens it with `responses`: the bodies every other
// Today GET would answer, keyed by the path the client asks with
// (routes/today-responses.ts), so the whole open is one trip. `?surface=session` (the
// Session destination) carries the Session's own reads the same way.
//
// Memoized on the response freshness key (routes/response-memo.ts): a repeat open
// with nothing logged since answers the stored body — or a 304 — without recomputing.
// A week-ahead refresh the fan-in kicked is remembered beside the body and re-kicked
// on every hit (ensureWeekAheadJob dedupes), as GET /week-ahead does on every serve.
