// Chat can see this morning's run, with its numbers.
//
// The live case (2026-09-29): the athlete asked the chat coach how his morning run
// went. The synced row was there — 9.68 km, 53.9 min, 5:34/km, avg HR 157 on the
// linked Garmin row, "Boston Running" — and the coach answered that "the specific
// Garmin metrics (distance, pace, and heart rate) for this morning's run aren't
// visible in my data right now", then on a follow-up that the "heart rate graph,
// splits, and exact pace" had not "pulled through". The only run evidence it had was
// the raw `recent_activities` storage rows buried in a several-hundred-KB single-line
// DATA JSON, km-only, with the heart rate packed into a free-text notes string.
//
//   • DATA.recent_cardio carries today's run the way a coach reads one — when, title,
//     distance and pace in the athlete's unit, duration, avg/max HR, stated effort, the
//     personal model's read — at every site that carries the endurance bundle;
//   • the chat prompt renders it as a plain block above DATA, with the rule that a
//     listed run is never "missing", that laps are one read away (read_activity_detail)
//     and that HR streams / GPS tracks are not stored;
//   • Garmin's training-effect number never rides as a verdict;
//   • the bounded read tool returns the heart rate as a field, not only in notes.
