// oneDayOneVoice.test.js — the 2026-09-29 morning, reproduced (owner ruling that day).
//
// A Pull day on a stated Mon–Fri lifting week. Push was logged yesterday. The oblique
// discomfort from last Thursday was resolved yesterday through its training symptom,
// while the chat turn that heard it had also filed an `injury` context event nobody
// closed. The athlete woke early ("sleep was not awesome but I feel good") and tapped
// sleep-feel 2, energy 5, soreness 1. The read said REST, excluded the back on a Pull
// day, and the week strip said nothing at all.
//
// What the athlete is owed: a train read (at most a lighter nudge), the back left in,
// no injury constraint from a resolved note, and every surface naming the day with the
// same suggestion. And the other direction must still hold: genuine objective red flags
// still rest.
